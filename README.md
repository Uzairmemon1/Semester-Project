# Semester-Project


“A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life”. - H.W. Beecher -
It’s our second semester in which we were assigned a project named LMS “Library Management System”. Library Management System is a system that maintains the information about the available books in the library, their authors, and the members of the library to whom books are issued and returned. This is very difficult to organize manually. But LMS reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduced.

Modules:

•	Admin login: Admin is the one who has the authority over the whole system.

•	View Members: The admin can view members of the library.

•	View Issued Books: The admin can view the books that are issued to students.

•	Issue Books: The admin can issue a book to a member of the library. The book will be deleted from the available book list. In case the student is not a member of the library, He / She is not eligible for issuing books.

•	Issue Books: The Students can issue the desired books by giving simply Roll No and book names from the available book list. In case the student is not a member of the library, He / She is not eligible for issuing books.

•	Return Books: The student can return the book by which was to his/her Roll No.

•	Logout: An act of logging out of the Admin Menu.
